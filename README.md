# ML-Bee-Research
After doing several projects on bees and the threat of varroa mites, I worked with alongside mentors in the AI Scholars program to create a machine learning model capable of differentiating between a healthy and unhealthy bee (infected by varroa mites or not infected). I used data augmentation and transfer learning to improve the model's accuracy.
