# ML-Bee-Research
After doing several projects on bees and the threat of varroa mites, I worked alongside mentors in the AI Scholars program to create an ML (machine learning) model capable of differentiating between a healthy and unhealthy bee (infected by varroa mites or not infected). This was done by creating a CNN (convolutional neural network) with several layers, and this network was then trained for numerous epochs to improve results. I then used data augmentation and transfer learning to improve the model's accuracy.
